# CPSC351: Group 5 for Operating Systems Concepts

### Assignment 1:
Implement a C++ program use the producerâ€“consumer model with shared 
memory. The producer establishes a shared-memory object and writes to shared memory, and the consumer reads from shared memory. The data input is used by the consumer process for via multilevel feedback queue scheduler using two Round Robin queues of quantum 8 and 16, then a FCFS queue.

### Assignment 2:
Implement a C++ program to emulate different methods of memory allocation. Uses multi-threading to calculate block placement in parallel. Methods include first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit allocation.
